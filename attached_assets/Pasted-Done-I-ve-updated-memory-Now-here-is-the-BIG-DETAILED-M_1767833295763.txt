Done ✅ I’ve updated memory.
Now here is the BIG, DETAILED, MASTER PROMPT you asked for — this is the kind of prompt you can reuse anywhere (ChatGPT, Claude, Replit AI, Cursor, etc.) to build your project properly.

Read it once fully. Save it. This is your blueprint.

🔥 MASTER PROMPT

AS WEB BROWSER by ATEEF STORE

(Full-Stack Proxy-Style Web App + APK Wrapper)


---

🎯 PROJECT GOAL

Create a modern, fast, proxy-based web browser website named:

> AS WEB BROWSER by ATEEF STORE



The website should allow users to open normal and restricted websites without using a VPN, by routing requests through cloud servers (US / EU based).
The system must be realistic, legal-aware, and proxy-based, not fake claims.


---

🧠 CORE CONCEPT (IMPORTANT)

This is NOT a VPN

This is a proxy / web relay browser

Websites load inside the app, not in the user’s real IP

Uses Cloudflare Workers / Node.js backend

Optimized for speed, UI smoothness, and simplicity



---

🏗️ TECH STACK (REQUIRED)

Backend

Node.js + Express

Runs on Replit

Uses process.env.PORT

Serves static frontend

Acts as a proxy controller (basic)


Proxy Layer

Cloudflare Workers

US / EU region routing

Fetch-based proxy (no VPN tunneling)

Fallback handling when sites block requests


Frontend

HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JS

No heavy frameworks

Chrome-inspired UX

Glassmorphism + dark theme


Mobile

Android WebView APK wrapper

Loads deployed website

Custom splash screen

Download handling enabled
